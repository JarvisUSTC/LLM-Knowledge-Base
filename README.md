# LLM Knowledge Base: A Journal-Style Archive 🧠

This repository is for periodically (weekly/monthly) logging and archiving learnings, observations, and reflections in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## 🚀 How It Works

1.  **Choose a Theme**: Based on the content you want to log, navigate to the appropriate thematic folder below.
2.  **Create a File**: Copy the `TEMPLATE.md` file from the root directory into that folder.
3.  **Rename the File**: Name the file using a `YYYY-MM.md` (monthly) or `YYYY-W[week_number].md` (weekly) format. For example, `2025-07.md` or `2025-W29.md`.
4.  **Fill it Out**: Open the new file and populate it with key information and your thoughts from that period.
